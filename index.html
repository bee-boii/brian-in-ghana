                        June 10, 2022—Departure!<br>
                        After Makenna kindly dropped me off at the airport in Phoenix, I thought I was well on my way to Ghana. However, my journey from the United States to Ghana fell victim to many of the woes that stereotypically plague international travel. After sitting on the tarmac for several hours, my flight was canceled, and my new itinerary did not indicate departure for another 24 hours! Makenna returned to pick me up—the tearful goodbye we had shared just hours earlier proved to be premature. Although, my secondary flight schedule proceeded smoothly, I arrived in Accra only to discover that my luggage had been lost! Luckily, I had packed my essentials in my carryon. I wouldn't see my bag for another 5 days...

                        The Flag of Ghana:<br>
                        Red represents the blood of those who died in the country’s struggle for independence.<br>
                        Yellow represents the country’s natural resources, like gold. Ghana was formerly known as the Gold Coast.<br>
                        Green represents the lush jungles that cover much of the country.<br>
                        The black star represents the “Hope of Africa” which Ghana embodies as the first sub-Saharan country to gain independence in 1957.

                        This is the Unite for Sight team I worked with throughout my time in Ghana. From left to right:
                        <br>That’s me!
                        <br>John—he drives the van, plays practical jokes, and is an all-around helping hand.
                        <br>Ernest—a hard-working optometrist and the team’s leader.
                        <br>Michael—one of the other Unite for Sight volunteers. He is a premed student at UNC.
                        <br>Jerome—an ophthalmic nurse and a real troublemaker!
                        <br>Lisa—she fulfills prescriptions that patients receive from Ernest and Jerome.
                        <br>Ari—another volunteer, and she is a premed student at Wesleyan.

                        Loading up the van for outreach!
                        <br>On weekdays our most common activity was to perform an eye care outreach. Each outreach consists of driving to meet patients in their community so that we can provide eye care on site. Outreach takes place in a different community each day. Some days we would drive hours before arriving on location, other days we would meet patients more locally. For two of the three weeks I spent in Ghana, we drove to another city and lodged there for the week. That way we could perform outreach in and around that city. As you can imagine, we had a lot of supplies to pack for a week-long trip, which is why my bag is getting strapped to the roof in this photo!

                        Ernest, the optometrist, gives a health talk.
                        <br>Each outreach begins with a health talk to better educate the patients about eye care. This was typically done by Ernest, the optometrist, but was occasionally given by a different member of the team if Ernest did not speak the local community’s language (English is the official language of Ghana, but there are a variety of indigenous languages used throughout the country). The health talk covered topics like how to complete the visual acuity exam, how to use eye drops, explaining why some traditional eye treatments are ineffective or even damaging, and dispelling myths around and extolling the benefits of cataract surgery.

                        Outreach consisted of four components:
                        <br>Registration—this is handled by local community event organizers who work with Unite for Sight to advertise the upcoming outreach to bring as many patients to receive care as possible.
                        <br>Visual Acuity Screen—patients sit 6 meters from an eye chart and are screened to get an idea of the state of their vision. The set up for this part of the outreach is depicted in this photo.
                        <br>Clinical Exam—Ernest and Jerome perform a physical exam on each patient to diagnose eye disease. Common conditions include cataract, glaucoma, or pterygium with less common cases of corneal ulcer or infection. Patients with operable conditions (like cataract) are given an appointment to undergo surgery in Accra.
                        <br>Distribution of Medication & Glasses—Patients who have been prescribed medication or reading glasses can purchase them on site at the outreach for a highly subsidized price. 
                    </div>

                        In this photo I am administering the visual acuity screen for a patient. You may be used to reading letters of various size when your vision is tested, but this chart works differently. The only character on the chart is a capital “E”, though it may be rotated 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. When I point at a specific “E”, the patient is instructed to motion with his or her hand in the direction which the “E” is facing. In this way, the patient’s visual acuity can still be tested, even if they do not know the English alphabet. Most of my time on each outreach was spent administering the visual acuity screen to patients. However, I also had the opportunity to help distribute medication and observe Ernest and Jerome while they examined patients.

                        Almost every outreach took place at a church or school. No matter our location, children would gather around to speak with us. Michael had a soccer ball that the kids loved to kick around with us!

                        I feel that his photo captures the look of many of the outlying towns we visited. A single road (this one in far better repair than most) lined by sheet metal homes and shops. In the distance, thick jungle adorns the hills.

                        Outreach always ran straight through lunch into the afternoon, so everyone was hungry by the time we wrapped things up. Our first stop on the way home was typically for food. The woman in this photo is pounding cassava until it becomes a sticky dough called fufu. Ghanaians tear off a piece of fufu, dip it in a spicy broth, and swallow the dough without chewing. The woman in the back right of the photo holds a ladle over a pot of bush meat stew. From what I understand, bush meat may include groundhog, goat, chicken, and/or snails.
                    </div>

                <li class="caption">
                    <div>
                        I’ll admit that I never got up the courage to try fufu or bush meat stew. However, I did try this dish which is somewhat similar to fufu. Rather than cassava, the balls on the left are made of rice, a food with which I am much more familiar.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        This is wachi, a common breakfast meal in Ghana. The main portion of the dish consists of rice and beans with a spicy sauce. The food to the right is spicy casava flakes. My favorite breakfast food in Ghana is called bofru (not pictured). It is essentially a large donut hole. Who could say no to that?

                        Selling food, especially beverages, in small plastic bags is common in Ghana. This is a photo of coco, a breakfast beverage that tasted like thick apple sauce with ginger. Purified water is also commonly sold in 500 ml plastic bags. In order to drink, one simply bites off the corner of the bag and squeezes the contents into one's mouth.

                        Throughout my time in Ghana, we always remained in the southern coastal region of the country. Many of the towns we visited are located right on the ocean. I felt that the weather was comfortably tropical, like Hawaii; however, I did visit during the coolest time of year.

                        This is Dr. Clark, an ophthalmologist and the face of Unite for Sight in Ghana. On two separate occasions I was able to attend his clinic in Accra and observe him operate on patients. Primarily I observed sight-restoring cataract surgeries. Additionally, I was able to observe him surgically treat pterygium and chalazion, as well as remove a painful blind eye. Dr. Clark is a fantastic physician who is dedicated to serving the people of his country.

                        On the weekends, we had time to explore Accra and the surrounding areas. Perhaps my favorite activity was visiting Kukrum National Park. The park features a stunning canopy walk that rises up to 40 meters above the jungle floor!

                        On our way home from the national park, we stopped to see some alligators. I was (foolishly) able to touch this female. We were told many visitors enjoy getting a photo while sitting on the larger males, but unfortunately, they were all in the water!

                        Another fantastic outing was our visit to Cape Coast Castle. This fort dates to the 16th century when it was established by Europeans as a trading outpost. It was initially a contact site for accessing the gold of Ghana. Later, countless slaves were tragically trafficked through this fort over hundreds of years. Although the fort changed hands multiple times, the final and longest running occupants were the British.

                        The shape featured at the center of this photo is called “gye nyame” and it is a symbol seen all throughout Africa. From what I understand, it is a traditional shape that reminds the viewer of an almighty God.

                        <br>Needless to say, my time in Africa was a fantastic experience. Not only did I learn much regarding eye care in Ghana, I also learned about the country's culture and people. Thank you again for your support!

            <p style="margin-top: 6rem;">Thank you so much for supporting my service in Ghana!</p>
            <p>I created this brief photo-journal to share my experiences with you.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">Hover over or click on each photo to display its description.</span> Navigate between the photos with the arrow buttons. I reccomend using Google Chrome if you have trouble with the website.</p>
            <p>Close this message by clicking the x in the upper right.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy! —Brian</p>
